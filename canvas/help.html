            <b>Drawing Canvas Help & Info:</b>
            <br>This tool lets you draw and plan UIs and graphics for Stormworks' Screens.
            <br>Here you'll find important information about the tool!
            <br>
            <br><b>Notes about shapes:</b>
            <br>Please have in mind that what you see displayed in this tool, often will not match what you see in-game.
            <br>Always double check how things are looking in-game, especially with triangles and circles.
            <br>
            <br>-Line: OK, slightly different at odd angles.
            <br>-Triangle: OK, slightly different at odd angles.
            <br>-TriangleF: OK, slightly different at odd angles.
            <br>-Circle: Doesn't always match, more so with larger circles.
            <br>-CircleF: Doesn't match at all (cause in-game circleF is an ugly monster).
            <br>
            <br>I was not always able to replicate Stormworks' way of drawing shapes, sometimes because it's hard, sometimes
            <br>because I couldn't be bothered... like with the ugly circles in-game that aren't even circles.
            <br>
            <br><b>Options Explained:</b>
            <br>-Color Fix: Does some math on the colors so they match better in SW screens. Gamma Fix function by XLjedi.
            <br>-Compact: Reduces the number of characters in a script by minimizing function names, e.g: sc = screen.setColor.
            <br>-Filled-Shape Fix: AMD and NVIDIA draw full rectangles/triangles differently. By adding 0.5 to the Y position, we fix it for both cards.
            <br>-Function Mode: Takes the entire drawing, turns it into a function with (x,y) parameters so you can move it around with your script. e.g: you are making a button.
